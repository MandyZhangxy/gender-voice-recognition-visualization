				<h1>Conlusion</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>The accuracy rates of all three models are over 97%, all the models performed well on prediction. Among these three, the random forest classification is the best, since its accuracy reaches 98.11%. Therefore,  random forest best model for gender recognition.</li>

					<li>The reason why all models have such high accuracy is that the input dataset is perfectly balanced and has no missing values. If our dataset is imbalanced or has many missing values, we need to rebalance the data and also do the imputation, which will decrease the performance of madels. </li>
						
					<li>Gender can be recognized by voice. We did three recognitions in demo. For the first trial, the person spoke too short, and there were some speaker' noise during recording, the result was false. The rest of two were correct.</li> 
						
					<li>After finishing the major parts of the project, we are still curious that what we can do next to make our machine smarter. What if people disguise their voice? What if we add some feigned voices into the dataset? Can this machine still do a good job? </li>
						
					<li>For feature selection, there might be some better algorithms to perform dimention reduction such as principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA). </li>
						
					<li>In validation process, we only randomly select test for one time. It's more appropriate if we did 10-fold cross validation. Then, the accuracy rate will be more 'accurate'. </li>
